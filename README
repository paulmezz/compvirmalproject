This is just a good place to put my project.  You probably don't care about it
at all.  When I'm done it will pull in a list of signatures from a file 
supplied and do a recursive search of a directory looking in all the files 
for those signatures.

ToDo list:
Wrap up the loops so it can step through every file with opens (and closes)

Search each file byte by byte for each signature.  

Determine longest signature and pull in that many bytes from the file being scanned
